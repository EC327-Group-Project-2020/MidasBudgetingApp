# MidasBudgetingApp

The goal of this project is to design and build an app that will allow users to sign in, create a budget, 
track and categorize expenses, and upload receipts for specific transactions using the Android phone's camera. 

The app should have the following core functionality:
- a user verification process (not connected to a database)
- a first-time setup including account name, initial balance, monthly income, and planned budget per category
- a home screen with visuals to track planned vs actual expenditures. 
- a way to add expenses, by category, including uploading receipts using the Android phone's camera. 

The app may also have additional functionality as time permits:
- user uploaded exchange rate and currency selection (success!! even built API update so no manual entry necessary)
- searchable financial literacy database (opted for tutorial instead, no need to rewrite the internet)
- image processing and AI to automatically interpret transactional data from receipt photos (Darren attempted this using Google ML Kit but found it too complex, so dropped the idea in week 2 after research and attempts)
- live API connections and summary of financial accounts, including transactions and balances (e.g. Plaid API) -- obviously beyond the scope of this course and none of us want to really front cash or personal identity to set up a real API to real financial institutions, not to mention the test bank accounts you would need to set up. 

# Instructions on how to set up the app

• All necessary code, build specifications and libraries are included in the .zip file submitted, so opening it and running in Android Studio should be all you need to do.

• Just incase something is not right, our github repository is public so please feel free to clone it and open with the Get From Version Control feature.
