# MidasBudgetingApp

The goal of this project is to design and build an app that will allow users to sign in, create a budget, 
track and categorize expenses, and upload receipts for specific transactions using the Android phone's camera. 

The app should have the following core functionality:
- a user verification process (not connected to a database)
- a first-time setup including account name, initial balance, monthly income, and planned budget per category
- a home screen with visuals to track planned vs actual expenditures. 
- a way to add expenses, by category, including uploading receipts using the Android phone's camera. 

The app may also have additional functionality as time permits:
- user uploaded exchange rate and currency selection
- searchable financial literacy database (included with app, not cloud-based)
- image processing and AI to automatically interpret transactional data from receipt photos
- live API connections and summary of financial accounts, including transactions and balances (e.g. Plaid API)

Task Specifications and Grading

Your project will be graded equally on the following three criteria:

1. Front-end
The user-interface for the project must be:
• crisp and intuitive (i.e., no instruction manual required), providing appropriate and understandable
feedback,
• robust to all sorts of behavior, normal or otherwise, meaning your project should neither crash nor
leave strange elements on the screen,
• visually pleasant, properly utilizing icons, backdrops, and graphical-user artifacts.

2. Back-end
The back-end code should be:
• efficient; it does not have to be optimal, but the user should not suffer a negative experience (e.g.,
long wait times, dropped information, etc.),
• robust to all manner of input from the user interface; i.e., the back-end should never crash or lock
in an infinite loop,
• secure (at a basic level), in that there should not be reasonably obvious ways to get the back-end to
do something malicious,
• well-documented (e.g., commented) and easy to understand by programmers with your level of
expertise.

3. Marketability
The basic question you should ask yourself is: “Would people use the project?”
• You should specify who might want to use the project, and for what purposes.
• It should be clear how the design decisions in the project conform to potential users of the project.
• Your project should include a concise and clear description targeted toward potential users.
• You should stay away from licensed or copyrighted content (e.g., pictures, games). 

# Instructions on how to set up the app

• All necessary code, build specifications and libraries are included in the .zip file submitted, so opening it and running in android studio should be enough.

• Just incase something is not right, our github repository is public so please feel free to clone it and open with the Get From Version Control feature.
